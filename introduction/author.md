> Keep Jesus number one in your life and in your heart.  I did and it changed my life from desolation, defeat and failure to an abundant life full of love, thankfulness, joy and overwhelming peace.  As this world breathes failure and fear upon any life, Jesus brings power, love and a sound mind to everybody!
